# Decentralized HomeAssistant Proxy

This project aims to create an innovative decentralized relay server for HomeAssistant. The server allows contributions from anyone and provides a fast and optimized path between clients.

## Features

- **Decentralized:** The server is designed to be decentralized, allowing anyone to contribute and participate in the network.

- **Fast Relay:** The relay server ensures fast and efficient communication between clients, optimizing the path for data transmission using the atm0s-sdn overlay network.

- **Data Safety:** The TCP proxy used in this project is based on SNI (Server Name Indication), ensuring the safety and integrity of the transmitted data.

- **Written in Rust:** The project is implemented in Rust, a modern and efficient programming language known for its performance and memory safety.
